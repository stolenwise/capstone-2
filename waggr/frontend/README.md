# Waggr

Waggr is a Tinder-style dog walking app where users can match with dogs from shelters and schedule walks.  
This project is built using **React** (frontend) and **Node/Postgres** (backend).  

## API

This project uses the [Petfinder API](https://www.petfinder.com/developers/) as the primary data source for shelter and dog information.

## Database

- `waggr-schema.sql` — defines the database schema  
- `waggr-seed.sql` — provides initial seed data (users, shelters, dogs, matches, bookings)  
- `waggr.sql` — reset script to drop, recreate, and seed both dev and test databases
